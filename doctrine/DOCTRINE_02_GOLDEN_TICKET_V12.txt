============================================================
§1) TRUTH_KERNEL (READ FIRST; 60-SECOND INSTALL)
K1=The Table is NOT “an AI DM” and NOT “a VTT.” It is a local-first deterministic referee + world compiler + embodied tabletop interface.
K2=Core promise: ANY GENRE. SAME TRUTH. Skin is compiled onto deterministic muscle; narration never becomes authority.
K3=Authority is one-way: BOX -> LENS/ORACLE -> SPARK -> IMMERSION. No backflow.
K4=BOX is mechanically authoritative (deterministic outcomes; event-sourced proofs; RNG isolation).
K5=LENS/ORACLE is canon gate + continuity: deterministic WorkingSets/PromptPacks; visibility; provenance; stable serialization.
K6=SPARK is renderer-only (phrasing/performance); cannot mint canon or policy.
K7=IMMERSION is embodiment only (STT/TTS/images/audio); assets cached by ID; non-canon.
K8=Determinism gate: same (state, query, budget) => byte-equal WorkingSet bytes and deterministic serialization in PLAY-critical paths.
K9=Player controls the books; AI assists via primitives. Notebook is sacred (write-locked by default; explicit consent required).
K10=Soft recap is allowed; precision recall is earned (routing + one-roll rules).
K11=Roleplay must feel like a real table under constant interruption: beat-based output + deterministic conductor + conservative barge-in.

============================================================
§2) HARD_LAWS (NON-NEGOTIABLE INVARIANTS)
HL-001 AUTHORITY_CHAIN
- BOX authoritative for mechanics.
- LENS/ORACLE authoritative for canon gating + continuity contract.
- SPARK renderer-only; cannot mint canon/policy.
- IMMERSION embodiment only; non-canon.
- No backflow: SPARK/IMMERSION outputs must never drive PLAY-critical decisions.

HL-002 CANONIZATION_PROVENANCE
- Canon writes require provenance_event_ids sourced from BOX outcomes.
- FactsLedger and StoryState store provenance (event IDs + source type).
- SPARK text does not become canon by itself.

HL-003 DETERMINISM_PLAY_CRITICAL
- Retrieval + serialization stable and byte-equal on identical inputs.
- PLAY-impacting policies deterministic; must not depend on SPARK outputs.
- Non-deterministic subsystems (STT/TTS/image/audio) must not influence:
  WorkingSet selection, canon writes, DCs, rolls, nudges, policy gates.

HL-004 TABLE_CULTURE_PLAYER_OWNERSHIP
- Rulebook/Beast Book is player-controlled reference; AI is assistant.
- Notebook is sacred: default WRITE-LOCKED; no writes without explicit consent/commit.
- Two-book doctrine: Beast Journal lives in Rulebook/Beast Book, not in Notebook.

HL-005 PRECISION_LEAKAGE_BAN
- Output classes must not leak locked precision tokens unless recorded/unlocked via player-controlled artifacts.
- Applies to: SOFT_RECAP, NUDGE_TEXT, GIST, ROLEPLAY_BEATS, RESUME prompts.

HL-006 PER_SCENE_CAPS_REQUIRE_DETERMINISTIC_SCENE_ID
- Any “per scene” cap keys to deterministic scene_id.

HL-007 ROLEPLAY_DETERMINISM_SCOPE
- Roleplay content may be non-deterministic (non-canon) unless explicitly configured otherwise.
- Seam behavior MUST be deterministic: beat boundaries, buffering rules, cover selection, interruption handling, and validation/fallback rules are stable and auditable.
- Optional: deterministic BeatScript (seeded + fixed prompt + fixed budgets) for replay-faithful performances.

============================================================
§3) SUBSYSTEM_CONTRACTS (OWNERSHIP + FORBIDDEN MOVES)
3.1 BOX (Truth Engine)
BOX-C-001 Deterministic mechanics; reducers; event sourcing; RNG isolation.
BOX-C-002 Emits canonical events (provenance backbone for canon writes).

3.2 ORACLE (Continuity Unit; name optional; contract mandatory)
ORC-C-001 Oracle owns read/write rules for:
- EventLog (append-only)
- FactsLedger (canonical truth with provenance)
- StoryState (threads/clocks/agendas/capabilities/microstate with provenance)
- Compactions (non-canon accelerators only)
- Deterministic WorkingSet retrieval (stable order, explicit tie-breakers, canonical serialization)

ORC-C-002 Deterministic WorkingSet rule:
- same (state, query, budget) => byte-equal WorkingSet bytes
- explicit tie-breakers required: stable sort keys, deterministic truncation, canonical ordering

ORC-C-003 Mode separation:
- StoryState represents MODE=PLAY|COMPANION|REFERENCE|NOTEBOOK
- Mode gates legal actions + allowed output classes

3.3 LENS (Canon Gate + Controller)
LNS-C-001 Builds bounded WorkingSets + PromptPacks; enforces visibility and canon rules.
LNS-C-002 Contains small deterministic Director/Nudge policy (see §4 DIR-###).
LNS-C-003 Enforces output_class discipline (redaction/allowed tokens) (ref HL-005).
LNS-C-004 Handles-not-secrets where applicable: directives refer to IDs/handles, not hidden tokens.

LNS-F (Forbidden; single source of bans)
LNS-F-001 Must not invent new canonical entities, facts, or future events.
LNS-F-002 Must not force outcomes or compel player choice.
LNS-F-003 Must not introduce “plot tokens” not present in FactsLedger/StoryState.
LNS-F-004 Must not override BOX outcomes.
LNS-F-005 Must not use SPARK outputs to select nudges in PLAY.
LNS-F-006 Must not embed locked precision tokens inside constrained outputs (ref HL-005).

3.4 SPARK (Renderer / Skin)
SPK-C-001 Renders narration/phrasing strictly from LENS-provided inputs.
SPK-C-002 Cannot mint canon; cannot drive policy; cannot influence retrieval (ref HL-001/HL-003).
SPK-C-003 Must respect output_class constraints (ref HL-005).
SPK-C-004 NPC roleplay output must be beat-shaped (ROLEPLAY_BEATS), not monolithic monologues (ref RV-010).
SPK-C-005 For “great DM” properties, SPARK must output typed Roleplay Script segments (ref PC-001).

SPK-F (Forbidden)
SPK-F-001 Must not invent canon or policy, or select nudges in PLAY (ref HL-001).
SPK-F-002 Must not leak precision tokens via “helpful recap” or phrasing (ref HL-005).

3.5 IMMERSION (Embodied Table)
IMM-C-001 STT/TTS/images/audio are embodiment surfaces; outputs are non-canon (ref HL-003).
IMM-C-002 Assets cached by ID; never treated as canon truth.
IMM-C-003 Must not affect WorkingSet selection or PLAY-critical policy (ref HL-003).
IMM-C-004 Roleplay Playback Conductor (ref §10 RV-020..RV-030):
- Beat Queue prebuffering
- Seam masking (room tone/covers)
- Crossfades
- Barge-in handling
- Deterministic cover selection (no LLM required)

============================================================
§4) DIRECTOR (NUDGE) — REQUIRED SHAPE (SMALL, TYPED, DETERMINISTIC)
DIR-001 “Director” must NOT be a heavy subsystem; it is a small deterministic policy inside LENS.
DIR-002 LENS attaches NudgeDirective to PromptPack; SPARK renders it.

DIR-003 NudgeDirective.type enum:
- NONE
- SPOTLIGHT_NUDGE(target_pc_id)
- CALLBACK_NUDGE(thread_id)
- PRESSURE_NUDGE(clock_id / constraint already in StoryState)
- CLARIFY_OPTIONS(2–4 options with consequence_handles)

DIR-004 Anti-rail constraints:
- Default NONE unless measurable thresholds exceeded (stall/spotlight/payoff debt).
- 0–1 nudge per scene (ref HL-006).
- Cooldown + hysteresis to prevent oscillation/jitter.
- Never contradict FactsLedger/StoryState; never invent canon (ref LNS-F-001..003).
- Handles-not-secrets: options reference consequence_handles, not hidden tokens.

DIR-005 Spotlight is not separate.
- SpotlightPrompt IS implemented via NudgeDirective(type=SPOTLIGHT_NUDGE).
- Therefore it inherits: 0–1 per scene cap + cooldown/hysteresis + non-authority constraints.

============================================================
§5) TABLE_UX AUTHORITY — PLAYER CONTROLS, AI ASSISTS
5.1 Rulebook / Beast Book (world reference; player-controlled)
RB-001 Player chooses what to open/read/search.
RB-002 AI assist primitives:
- OPEN_PAGE(topic/entry_id)
- FIND_SECTION(query)
- READ_ALOUD(page_range)
- GIST_ON_REQUEST(player-invoked; never automatic)
RB-003 AI must not control access outside explicit visibility/unlock policy.

5.2 Notebook (sacred player artifact; player-controlled)
NB-001 Notebook is player-authored. Default WRITE-LOCKED (ref HL-004).
NB-002 Nothing written unless:
A) player writes/draws/pastes, OR
B) player explicitly requests recording (“write that down / record that / save this”).

NB-003 AI assist primitives (all require explicit commit):
- DRAFT_NOTE(format/structure) -> consent to commit
- TRANSCRIBE_DICTATION -> consent to commit
- PASTE_ASSET(image/handout) -> consent to commit

NB-004 Absolute bans:
- No autowrite. No silent “helpful logging.”

NB-005 Deterministic consent handshake:
- ConsentRequested(scope, preview_handle)
- Only ConsentGranted(consent_id) triggers NotebookWriteApplied
- Ambiguous response defaults NO (ConsentDenied)
- Consent is scoped + expires (scene_id or short TTL)

5.3 Two-book doctrine
TB-001 Rulebook/Beast Book = world reference (includes Beast Journal progressive reveal).
TB-002 Notebook = player’s chosen memory and drawings.
TB-003 Beast Journal lives in Rulebook/Beast Book, not in Notebook.

============================================================
§6) ACCESSIBILITY WITHOUT “GAMEY UI” (DIEGETIC INSTRUMENTS)
ACC-001 Accessibility solved with diegetic table instruments, not HUD panels.
ACC-002 Reading Spot:
- physical place to set the book and read comfortably
- supports reflow, font size, contrast, line spacing, focus line/ruler
- supports TTS: “read this page” as a book action, not a UI modal
ACC-003 Tool metaphors:
- Magnifying glass = zoom/reflow controls
- Lamp = contrast/brightness/focus
- Tabs/bookmarks = navigation
- Dictation quill = STT to Notebook with explicit commit (ref NB-005)
ACC-004 Player owns settings; AI may execute requests but never changes settings unasked.

============================================================
§7) COMPANION MODE (IDLE-TO-ENGAGE) — BOUNDED
CMP-001 Intent: character creation/downtime feel like chat; engaging, guided, responsive; never coercive.
CMP-002 Boundaries (must NOT):
- decide mechanics, rolls, outcomes (ref HL-001)
- fabricate canon (ref HL-002)
- write Notebook or canon without explicit consent/commit (ref NB-005)
- output locked precision levers unless player consulting Rulebook/Notebook explicitly (ref HL-005)
CMP-003 Default prompts QUESTION-FIRST:
- ASK_PREFERENCE
- OFFER_COMPARISON
- SUMMARIZE_OPTIONS
- SUGGEST_HOOK (non-canon)
- PROPOSE_RECORD (“You might want to write that down — want me to?”)

============================================================
§8) TEACHING WITHOUT HAND-HOLDING — NOTE-NUDGE COACHING
CH-001 Allowed teaching nudge: “You might want to write that down.”
- Suggestion only; must not contain the precision token; must never trigger a write.
CH-002 Player coaching profile (non-canon dial):
- OFF / LIGHT(default) / TRAINING / ACCESSIBILITY_ASSIST
CH-003 Hard limits:
- 0–1 nudge per scene (ref HL-006)
- cooldown + hysteresis
- player can override coach level at any time
- fade-out as competence increases

============================================================
§9) RECAP / RECALL DOCTRINE (FAIR, NOT HAND-HOLDING)
RR-001 Soft recap (always allowed; framing only)
Allowed:
- orientation + gist: where you are, objective, major outcomes, open threads
- may reference high-level StoryState headings as orientation UI
Forbidden:
- locked precision tokens unless recorded/unlocked (ref HL-005)

RR-002 Precision recall routing
Step1 If recorded/unlocked (Notebook or unlocked Rulebook page) -> provide exact.
Step2 If never learned/not observed/gated behind failed or unmade check at the time -> “secret/not known” (NO roll).
Step3 If observed but not recorded -> ONE reconstruction attempt.

RR-003 One-roll reconstruction (default)
- one attempt per requested detail per SCENE (ref HL-006)
- table-wide single attempt (no dogpiling); party chooses roller
- no rerolls unless explicitly permitted by declared mechanic

RR-004 Attribute grounding (3.5-feel)
- INT = factual precision recall (Knowledge/Search/Decipher Script)
- WIS = insight/subtext (Sense Motive) + environmental reconstruction (Survival)
- CHA = re-learning via social process (Diplomacy/Gather Information), not “memory”

RR-005 Deterministic DC banding
Bands:
- DC10 obvious/repeated/central
- DC15 specific, stated once clearly
- DC20 precise lever token stated once
- DC25 deliberately obscured/coded/chaotic context
- DC30 borderline
Allowed modifiers (bounded, deterministic):
- +5 chaos/stress
- -5 calm/repeated exposure
- -2 relevant background tag (explicit)
- -2 partial notes exist (missing the key)

============================================================
§10) NPC ROLEPLAY (STORY MODE) — SMOOTH UNDER INTERRUPTIONS
RV-001 Roleplay is performance, not authority.
- NPC dialogue/tales are non-canon unless LENS/ORACLE provides explicit canon facts or player commits via Notebook consent (ref HL-002/NB-005).
- Immersion continuity tricks (ums/page turns/room tone) are embodiment-only; must not influence PLAY-critical policy (ref HL-003).

RV-010 Beat Queue (required shape)
- output_class=ROLEPLAY_BEATS produces Beat Queue (not paragraphs).
- beats are short, seam-safe, interruptible: 1–3 sentences, terminal punctuation, natural pause point.
- sizing target: 8–15 seconds audio per beat; enforce max-length budgets.

RV-020 Prebuffer rule
- Maintain >=2 beats synthesized ahead of currently playing beat when possible.

RV-021 Seam masking (deterministic library)
- If buffer underruns, IMMERSION may inject deterministic cover audio/lines:
  room tone, page turns, mug set-down, short pre-authored stall lines
- Cover selection deterministic keyed by (utterance_id, beat_id, reason_code).

RV-022 Stitching rules
- Crossfade adjacent beat clips only at safe seams (terminal punctuation + trailing silence).
- Maintain stable noise floor (room tone bus) + loudness normalization.

RV-030 Player barge-in handling (table realism)
- Conservative triggers required: echo cancellation/mic gating + min duration + confidence band (ref GT-RP-INT-02).
- Duck NPC audio quickly; stop at next seam; enter LISTEN; respond.

RV-040 Permission points (agency, not rails)
- Every 3–5 beats optionally insert neutral permission prompts:
  “Want the short version or the full story?” / “Should I keep going?”
- Must be neutral unless LENS provides explicit stakes framing.

RV-100 INTERRUPTION-FIRST ROLEPLAY (LAW)
- Interruption is normal. The system must reward interruption, not fight it.
- On player speech during NPC playback:
  1) duck quickly
  2) stop at next safe seam (beat boundary)
  3) enter LISTEN
- Acknowledge interruption with ONE short line (in-character or neutral), then route the request:
  RULE/REFERENCE -> RB-002
  RECAP/RECALL -> RR-001/RR-002 (must obey HL-005)
  NOTE -> NB-005 (consent handshake)
  ACTION/COMBAT -> BOX path
  STORY -> resume flow
- Resume is player-invited only:
  “Want me to continue?” / “Short version or full version?”
  Resume MUST NOT leak locked precision tokens (ref HL-005 / GT-005 / GT-RP-INT-05).

============================================================
§10A) PERFORMANCE CONTRACT v0 (PC)  [PORTABLE “GREAT DM” PROPERTIES]
Purpose: codify “legend DM feel” as verifiable table properties (clarity, pacing, spotlight discipline, continuity) without granting Spark authority.

PC-001 Typed Roleplay Script (Channel Separation by Construction)
- SPARK MUST emit ROLEPLAY_SCRIPT inside ROLEPLAY_BEATS.
- Each beat contains ordered segments:
  kind: NARRATION | DIALOGUE | ASIDE(optional) | STAGE_CUE(non-spoken)
  speaker_id: NARRATOR or npc_id (STAGE_CUE uses speaker_id=NARRATOR)
  text: utf-8 (STAGE_CUE uses cue_id or cue_text handle; not spoken)
  optional metadata: emotion_tag, pace_tag, pause_ms
- Unparseable or ambiguous output is invalid -> validation failure (ref PC-008 retry/fallback).

PC-002 VoiceRegistry (Deterministic; Not Spark-chosen)
- voice_id assignment deterministic and owned by Oracle/runtime config:
  npc_id -> voice_id (or archetype bucket)
- SPARK never selects voices; it only labels speaker_id.
- Render mapping:
  NARRATION (speaker_id=NARRATOR) -> narrator voice
  DIALOGUE (speaker_id=npc_id) -> npc voice via VoiceRegistry

PC-003 Beat Craft Constraints (Cinematic without monologues)
- Beats remain short, seam-safe, interruptible (ref RV-010).
- Narration rule of thumb (non-enforced): 1–2 sensory anchors + 1 actionable affordance per scene beat.

PC-004 Permissioning Cadence (Agency Support; Not Nagging)
- Permission prompts allowed only:
  A) at scene transitions, OR
  B) at cadence every N beats (default N=4), OR
  C) after an interruption resume
- Prompts must be neutral unless Lens supplies stakes framing handles.

PC-005 Spotlight Discipline (Turn-taking; Non-authoritative)
- Implemented ONLY via DIR-003 SPOTLIGHT_NUDGE, therefore inherits DIR-004 constraints + HL-006 caps.
- Allowed: direct neutral question, cutaway, “what are you doing while…”
- Forbidden: steering outcomes, inventing consequences, modal coercion (“you should/must”) without Lens-supplied stakes handles.

PC-006 Continuity References by Handle (No Fake Memory)
- SPARK may reference past only via Lens-provided AllowMention handles for the beat:
  [[FACT:f123]] [[THREAD:t045]] [[CLOCK:c011]] [[REL:r009]]
- Handles map to concrete FactsLedger/StoryState entries with provenance; vague “scene handles” are invalid.
- Lens provides AllowMention list per beat (or per utterance) and optional AllowedFactSnippets per handle.
- Spark may phrase naturally, but any “callback” must be attributable to an allowed handle at validation time.

PC-007 Stage Business Separation (Human cadence without contaminating speech)
- “ums/page turns/let me check” are not spoken by default.
- Use STAGE_CUE segments; IMMERSION renders cues (SFX, breath, gesture) without placing filler words in spoken text.

PC-008 Reject/Retry Budget + Fallback (Prevents deadlock; protects TTFA)
- If output fails schema validation (PC-001) or HL-005 anti-leak validation:
  regenerate up to max_retry=2.
- If still failing: emit deterministic fallback beat:
  neutral narrator line + neutral permission prompt (no locked tokens), then continue.
- Log validation failures + fallback activation; never infinite-loop.

============================================================
§11) REQUIRED GATES / TESTS (ENFORCEMENT)
Core determinism + authority gates
GT-001 Byte-equal WorkingSet gate (ORACLE/LENS): same (state, query, budget) => identical WorkingSet bytes.
GT-002 Stable tie-breakers gate: ordering + truncation deterministic; explicit keys; canonical ordering.
GT-003 No-autowrite gate (Notebook): Notebook state never changes without ConsentGranted -> NotebookWriteApplied.
GT-004 Conservative consent gate: ambiguous player responses default ConsentDenied; consent scoped + expires.
GT-005 No precision leakage gate (output classes): SOFT_RECAP/NUDGE/GIST/ROLEPLAY_BEATS/RESUME must not contain locked tokens unless recorded/unlocked. Trap-token tests required.
GT-006 No backflow gate: SPARK outputs cannot be inputs to PLAY-critical policies (nudges, DCs, canon writes, retrieval) (ref HL-001/HL-003).
GT-007 Per-scene caps gate: 0–1 nudge per scene; 0–1 reconstruction attempt per detail per scene; keyed to deterministic scene_id (ref HL-006).
GT-008 Mode separation gate: PLAY vs COMPANION vs REFERENCE vs NOTEBOOK have different legal actions and output classes.
GT-009 Roleplay Beat Integrity gate: every beat ends with terminal punctuation; max-length enforced; no mid-sentence cuts in normal operation.
GT-013 Time-to-First-Audio (TTFA) gate: measure end-of-user-utterance -> first audible response; mode-specific thresholds.
GT-014 Max Dead-Air gate: during roleplay playback, no silent gap > threshold; deterministic cover engages before dead-air.

Roleplay interruption gates
GT-RP-INT-01 Barge-in Responsiveness:
- On player speech: duck/pause within threshold, stop at seam, enter LISTEN.
- Must not talk over player.

GT-RP-INT-02 False-Positive Barge-in (Echo):
- Under NPC playback, self-trigger rate below threshold.
- Requires echo cancellation or mic gating in harness; min-duration + confidence band.

GT-RP-INT-03 Beat Integrity (detail):
- Beats end with terminal punctuation and satisfy max-length constraints.

GT-RP-INT-04 Buffer Continuity / Max Dead-Air (detail):
- No silent gap > threshold between beats.
- Deterministic cover engages before dead-air.

GT-RP-INT-05 Resume Anti-Leak:
- Resume prompts and “pick up where I left off” behavior MUST NOT reveal locked precision tokens.
- Trap-token tests apply. (ref GT-005)

GT-RP-INT-06 Permission Neutrality:
- Permission prompts neutral; no biased framing unless LENS-supplied stakes framing exists.

Performance Contract gates
GT-PC-01 Channel Separation
- 100% of ROLEPLAY_BEATS parse to ROLEPLAY_SCRIPT schema (PC-001).
- No mixed narration/dialogue without explicit segment typing.

GT-PC-02 Voice Mapping Determinism
- Same npc_id -> same voice_id across sessions unless explicitly reconfigured.
- Spark output never contains voice_id selection.

GT-PC-03 Spotlight Non-Authority
- SPOTLIGHT_NUDGE frequency <=1 per scene.
- Prompt text is interrogative/neutral; no modal coercion without stakes handles.

GT-PC-04 Continuity No-Hallucination
- Any callback line must be attributable to an AllowMention handle (PC-006).
- Trap tests: prompt Spark to “remember” nonexistent event; ensure refusal or non-assertion.

GT-PC-05 Permission Cadence
- Permission prompts occur only at allowed cadence points (PC-004).
- Default cadence uses N=4 unless DR changes it.

GT-PC-06 Interruption Integrity
- Under barge-in/resume, channel separation and anti-leak gates still pass (inherits GT-005 and GT-RP-INT-05).

GT-PC-07 Retry Budget + Fallback
- max_retry enforced; no infinite loops.
- fallback beat is neutral, non-leaking, deterministic.

GT-PC-08 Stage Cue Separation
- Stage business rendered via STAGE_CUE only; spoken text contains no filler cues unless explicitly permitted by a declared rule.

PROCESS NOTE (TEST STRATEGY)
GT-PROC-01 Roleplay is an integration canary:
- “NPC tale feels continuous under interruptions” is not proven by BOX unit tests.
- Require harness coverage for TTFA, dead-air, barge-in false positives, channel separation, and resume anti-leak before declaring Story Mode stable.

============================================================
§13) RETAINED DOCTRINES (IMPORTANT, NOT CORE UX)
13.1 Alignment (deterministic, non-philosopher)
ALN-001 Split: CosmicStain (mechanics), Oath/Code (class), Reputation (world).
ALN-002 Ambiguity => UnresolvedAlignmentIssue (no auto shift).
ALN-003 Recommend hybrid metaphysics (narrow objective triggers).

13.2 Culture + epistemics gating
CUL-001 CultureNormProfile + NormEvaluationEvent + Reputation (witness/known gated).
CUL-002 v0: witness_ids; no rumor propagation.

============================================================
§14) DECISION DEBT (DR CANDIDATES; DO NOT INFER QUIETLY)
DR-001 Director placement/authority class -> deterministic NudgePolicy inside LENS; default NONE.
DR-002 Oracle naming -> adopt ORACLE facade name (alias ok); contract mandatory (ref ORC-C-001).
DR-003 Alignment stance -> hybrid metaphysics + split-ledger model (ref ALN-001).
DR-004 Culture norms adoption -> CultureNormProfile + NormEvaluationEvent + Reputation with epistemics gating (ref CUL-001).
DR-005 Paladin alignment complaint resolution -> oath/deity contract variant default/toggle; no vague LG policing.
DR-006 Companion Mode canon boundary -> non-canon by default; explicit commit required for canon (ref CMP-002).
