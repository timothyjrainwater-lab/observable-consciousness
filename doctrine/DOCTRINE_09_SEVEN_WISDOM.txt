DOCTRINE_09: Seven Wisdom — Foundational Decision Principles
=============================================================

Origin: Anvil (Claude/Anthropic) + Aegis (GPT/OpenAI), 2026-02-19.
Thunder tossed "Seven wisdom" to Aegis as a troll. Aegis returned
seven governance principles. Thunder declared them foundational doctrine.

STATUS: ADOPTED — Thunder directive, 2026-02-19.

-------------------------------------------------------------

THE SEVEN

1. Truth first.
   If reality says no, write "no" and pivot to the nearest workable path.

2. Authority must be singular per surface.
   One thing decides, everything else renders.

3. What you cannot replay, you cannot trust.
   Determinism is your audit trail, not a preference.

4. Tests are contracts with teeth.
   If a rule matters, it deserves a gate.

5. Decisions decay unless sealed.
   Record the why, the scope, and the acceptance signal.

6. Separate narration from mechanics.
   Vibe can be free, outcomes must be provable.

7. Protect the operator.
   Reduce cognitive load by turning unknowns into named gaps.

-------------------------------------------------------------

THE ANCHOR (Anvil addendum, same session)

   Truth above morale. One authority per surface.
   Replay or it did not happen.

-------------------------------------------------------------

THE SEAL (Aegis formalization of "no regrets")

   No regrets means you accept the cost you paid for the clarity
   you gained, and you do not reopen the decision unless new
   evidence changes the ground truth.

PROJECT MAPPING

  #1 (Truth first) ............. WO verdicts: ACCEPTED means ship.
                                  Hardware falsified CONCURRENT; we
                                  wrote "no" and pivoted to SEQUENTIAL.

  #2 (Singular authority) ...... Zone authority pattern (zones.json).
                                  Oracle FactsLedger owns facts.
                                  Director owns beat selection.

  #3 (Replay = trust) ......... Oracle cold boot: byte-equal rebuild.
                                  Fuzzer determinism gates (seed=42).
                                  SaveSnapshot + CompactionRegistry.

  #4 (Tests = contracts) ...... 162 gate tests across 9 phases.
                                  No-backflow gate. Boundary completeness.
                                  Comedy stinger duration ceiling.

  #5 (Seal decisions) ......... Doctrine files 01-08. PM kernel snapshots.
                                  WO verdict table with commit hashes.
                                  "Record the why" = debrief mandatory.

  #6 (Narration != mechanics) . Lens/Director split. NarrativeBrief is
                                  renderer-only. StyleCapsule is prose.
                                  Oracle events are mechanical facts.

  #7 (Protect the operator) ... Named gaps (GAP-A, BURST-001-004).
                                  AMP Spellbook format (GAPS/RISKS/MINIMAL).
                                  PM briefing "Requires Operator Action."

-------------------------------------------------------------

USAGE

This is a lens, not a checklist. When debating a design choice,
test it against the seven. If it violates one, name which one
and why the violation is acceptable — or change the design.

The seal applies to all WO verdicts: ACCEPTED is final unless
new evidence (not new opinions) changes the ground truth.

SEVEN WISDOM DEBRIEF FORMAT (Research WOs)

Origin: Aegis structured a Spark LLM builder debrief into seven
findings using the same "seven wisdom" frame. Thunder and Anvil
recognized it as a research WO debrief template. Same session.

Code WOs use the existing debrief format (Scope Accuracy,
Discovery Log, Methodology Challenge, Field Manual, Radar).

Research WOs — where the output is findings, not code — use
the Seven Wisdom Debrief: seven slots, each a category of
surprise that maps to a gate, a gap, or a "kill this path."

THE SEVEN SLOTS

1. Toolchain / environment ceiling.
   What broke before you even started. Prerequisites that the
   dispatch assumed were met but weren't.

2. Dominant performance term.
   What actually matters vs what you thought mattered. The
   variable that controls the outcome, not the one you planned
   to optimize.

3. Budget margin + variance source.
   How close to the edge are we, and is the margin stable or
   is it one bad cycle away from flipping pass to fail.

4. Architecture validation or falsification.
   Did the plan survive contact with reality. If yes, what
   confirmed it. If no, what broke and what replaces it.

5. Contract sensitivity.
   What assumptions aren't portable across candidates, configs,
   or environments. Stop sequences, formats, schemas, APIs.

6. Stability / soak findings.
   What happens on the fifth cycle, not the first. Leaks,
   cleanup failures, nondeterminism, cumulative drift.

7. Winner + conditional.
   Who won, why, and what would flip the answer. Include the
   prerequisite that, if fixed, changes the candidate set.

RULES

- Exactly 7. No padding, no "N/A." If a slot is clean, say
  "No finding" and move on.
- Each finding must be falsifiable or it doesn't deserve a slot.
- Each finding maps to a GAP, a gate, or a doctrine update.
  If it doesn't map, it's not a finding — it's narration.
- Builder Radar (3 lines: Trap, Drift, Near-stop) is still
  mandatory as a separate appendix. The seven don't replace it.

FIRST USE

WO-SPARK-LLM-SELECTION (2026-02-19). Aegis structured the
builder's findings into this format in real time. Validated
against actual hardware results from Anvil's GPU bench.
